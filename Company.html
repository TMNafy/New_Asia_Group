<div class="ex2"> The New Asia Group (NAG) operates in a ‘shadow group structure,’ which means that each of the ‘subsidiary’
 companies have a common chairman and a common group of majority shareholders. However, each ‘subsidiary’company has its own pro-rata capital structure, with a unique set of minority shareholders (whether public or private).<br><br>

Amongst the ‘subsidiary companies,’ Malek Spinning Mills Limited and Rahim Textile Mills Limited are currently publicly 
listed entities on both the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock Exchange, whereas all other ‘subsidiary’ 
companies are privately held.
