<hr>
<div class="ex2">We call ourselves “New Asia”, as we believe that Bangladesh will be the next major manufacturing hub of Asia, and we aim to provide a brand of customer-service that exceeds what you have experienced elsewhere in the world.<br><br>

The advent of new media and the digital marketplace, has transformed consumer behavior in the fashion industry. Today, brands across the fashion pyramid are changing their business models by shortening their traditional selling seasons and producing more collections per year. Concurrent with such shortened product lifecycles, is an overwhelming demand to offer a wider variety of stylish, high quality and affordable clothing within each collection. As such, choosing a strategic sourcing and manufacturing partner who will produce the right product, within the right lead-time, and at the right price, has never been more critical nor more challenging. This is precisely our competitive advantage.<br><br>

We pride ourselves in being a ‘one-stop-shop’ apparel manufacturer, who can provide a comprehensive set of ‘fibre-to-garment’ solutions for our customers. Our diverse product range, which includes casual knitwear, sweaters, denim and intimates for men, women and children, allows our customers to source a significant proportion of their seasonal collection from our factories. We complement this advantage, through our vertically-integrated business model, which allows us to considerably reduce lead times by sourcing the downstream production of yarn, fabric (either knit or woven) and allover-printing through our own factories. Finally, our highly effective critical path management processes allow us to coordinate seamlessly with our customers over the duration of the product development cycle to ensure that we meet their strict quality standards.<br><br>

By working with us, our customers not only encounter a strong sourcing and manufacturing partner, but also a socially responsible employer. Despite the frenetic pace of the apparel manufacturing industry, we never lose sight of the people who enable us to deliver on our promises and, thereby, help sustain our competitive advantage. Every year we launch new employee-benefit schemes to maintain our position as the employer-of-choice within our industry. Most recently, we launched an entirely gratis micro-health insurance scheme for our workers and the year before we launched a fund to educate up to two children (per-worker-family) from kindergarten through high school for all our employees. We are proud of our Bangladeshi heritage and are passionate about contributing our part to the development of our nation through such initiatives.<br><br>

If you share the same vision, we welcome you to join us and become a part of this, truly special, ‘New Asia’ movement.
